His personal encounter with health struggles took a significant turn when he fell critically ill, spending five weeks in the ICU due to HLH disease. Enduring a 40-pound weight loss, predominantly lean tissue, Jared attributes his survival to the initial muscle tissue he had built over the years. Now weighing over 180 pounds, a remarkable recovery from his ICU weight of 150 pounds, Jared underscores the importance of muscle for longevity and for overall well-being. His story embodies the essence of bouncing back, with a focus on strength and muscle memory, helping to bring him back to his original 193 pounds from his time in the ICU and his current resilient state.</div>\n",

Pak has worked for over 5 years with physique athletes, powerlifters, and recreationally active individuals looking to get stronger and improve their body composition. He believes that a genuinely evidence-based approach to training and nutrition should be guided by the current available scientific evidence as well as professional experience, while factoring in individual preferences and idiosyncrasies.
