Pak has worked for over 5 years with physique athletes, powerlifters, and recreationally active individuals looking to get stronger and improve their body composition. He believes that a genuinely evidence-based approach to training and nutrition should be guided by the current available scientific evidence as well as professional experience, while factoring in individual preferences and idiosyncrasies. As a coach, his aim is to create a collaborative atmosphere, based on the consolidation of his experience and the client's feedback, which in turn will generate an adaptive plan of action that best suits the client's goals.\n",

His personal encounter with health struggles took a significant turn when he fell critically ill, spending five weeks in the ICU due to HLH disease. Enduring a 40-pound weight loss, predominantly lean tissue, Jared attributes his survival to the initial muscle tissue he had built over the years. Now weighing over 180 pounds, a remarkable recovery from his ICU weight of 150 pounds, Jared underscores the importance of muscle for longevity and for overall well-being. His story embodies the essence of bouncing back, with a focus on strength and muscle memory, helping to bring him back to his original 193 pounds from his time in the ICU and his current resilient state.\n",
